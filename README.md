# mrSegmentation

A plugin for Meshroom that provides nodes and templates to perform segmentation-related tasks.

The implementation of this plugin relies on the following models:
- [Recognize Anything Plus Model (RAM++)](https://github.com/xinyu1205/recognize-anything?tab=readme-ov-file#toolbox-checkpoints)
- [Grouding DINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO?tab=readme-ov-file#hammer_and_wrench-install)
- [Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything?tab=readme-ov-file#segment-anything)

A repository containing these models can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/alicevision/imagepromptnnmodels).
